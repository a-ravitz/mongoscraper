scraper

This project was a full stack appliction that utilized nodejs, the cheerio package to scrape materials from Al Jazeera, and mongodb and mongoose for database support. The basic idea is that the app scrapes articles from https://www.aljazeera.com/, then adds them to the page which can be saved and commented upon.
